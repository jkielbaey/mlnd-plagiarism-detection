Each directory has a `train.py` training script. To complete this project **you only need to complete one of these scripts**; the script that is responsible for training your final model.\n",

SVM supports a non-linear boundary, which means it can handle more complicated data sets. The risk with non-linear boundaries is that they can result in overfitting. However the margin maximization helps SVM to avoid overfitting even in classification problems with a small data set.\n",
